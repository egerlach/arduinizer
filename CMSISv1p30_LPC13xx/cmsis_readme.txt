CMSIS : Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard
==========================================================
CMSIS defines for a Cortex-M Microcontroller System:

    * A common way to access peripheral registers and a 
      common way to define exception vectors.
    * The register names of the Core Peripherals and the 
      names of the Core Exception Vectors.
    * An device independent interface for RTOS Kernels 
      including a debug channel.

By using CMSIS compliant software components, the user can 
easier re-use template code. CMSIS is intended to enable the
combination of software components from multiple middleware 
vendors. 

This project contains appropriate files for this MCU family 
taken from CMSIS. A full copy of the CMSIS files can be found
